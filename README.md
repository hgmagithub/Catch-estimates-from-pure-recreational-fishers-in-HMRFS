# Improved partitioning of commercial and non-commercial Deep7 bottomfish catch in the main Hawaiian Islands



## Summary
For the Deep7 bottomfish research track, adjustments were made to both catch rate and fishing effort to exclude fishing trips that were not entirely recreational/non-commercial from the HMRFS data. Two adjustments were made during the catch rate estimation: 1) catch claimed as sold in HMRFS was excluded; and 2) catch claimed as non-sold by expense fishers and part-time commercial fishers was also excluded. Fishing effort estimates (derived from telephone and mail surveys) were adjusted to exclude trips from expense and part-time commercial fishers. The estimates from this exploration may better define the catch from fishers who do not have a commercial marine license.
